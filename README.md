My biggest project as of 2021.
Used cool things:
-Animator
-SoundManager
-Field of View using mesh renderer
-Communication with phpMyAdmin to upload and download best times of players to beat the game

In this game you are a student, trying to pass exams by cheating. Avoid teachers field of view and cheat whole exam from geek to pass test.
